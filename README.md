# nightStep â€“ A Project for Showcasing Venues

**nightStep** is a single-page application that allows venue operators, such as clubs and bars, to present their locations clearly and attractively. Operators can post events, upload images, and maintain a small personal blog through the application, while users in the "Guest" role can visit the individual venue pages and learn about their offerings.
